# Lovense Forza #

An Unofficial integration with Forza to Vibrate toys as you play using the In-build Telemetry / Data Out feature. Vibrate while you drive. ðŸ˜Ž

> Please note, that this should be used for Single player enjoyment or Multiplayer with Consenting participants. This mod shouldn't be used with Unsuspecting players in Multiplayer games*

## Setup ##

Inside of Forza you are required to setup a few different settings to spit out the required Telemetry Data for us to know all the stats. *This is a the guide provided for usage for [Forza.js](https://github.com/MatthewCash/forza.js#usage)*

### Enable "Data Out" in Forza Settings ###

- This is usually near the bottom of `HUD AND GAMEPLAY`
- Set IP address to `127.0.0.1` and port to

| Game               | Port |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| Forza Motorsport 7 | 9917 |
| Forza Horizon 4    | 9924 |
| Forza Horizon 5    | 9925 |

### Network Isolation ###

Steam/Linux players will not have to do this but for Xbox / Windows store owners, Windows Apps prevent localhost connections by default for "security" This will need to be disabled for this program to work

Thankfully it can be done on a per-app basis by running the corresponding powershell command for your game:

#### Forza Motorsport 7 ####

```cmd
CheckNetIsolation.exe LoopbackExempt -a -n="microsoft.apollobasegame`_`1.174.4791.2_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe"
```

#### Forza Horizon 4 ####

```cmd
CheckNetIsolation.exe LoopbackExempt -a -n="microsoft.sunrisebasegame_8wekyb3d8bbwe"
```

#### Forza Horizon 5 ####

```cmd
CheckNetIsolation.exe LoopbackExempt -a -n="microsoft.624F8B84B80_8wekyb3d8bbwe"
```

## Starting the app ##

`npm start`

Triggers the start function in `package.json` which simply runs node on `index.js`

## Telemetry to choose from ##

Telemetry to pick between:

- `rpm`            *- RPM from the Engine **(Best all around experience)***
- `speed`          *- Current Speed, slow but fun*
- `rumble-average` *- Surface Rumble **(Average)***
- `power`          *- Not quite sure, seems to be a similar thing to RPM.*
- `torque`         *- Torque of the Vehicle*
- `accel`          *- How hard are you pushing down on the **Accelerate** Pedal*
- `brake`          *- How hard are you pushing down on the **Brake** Pedal*

## Where to get toy Data ##

Enable Lovense and connect it to a device `pc, android, ios` then visit the API pagethat is now available on your lan that will return a `json` document by clicking [api/lan/getToys](https://api.lovense.com/api/lan/getToys)

You are looking for the

- **platform** - *pc, android, ios*
- **domain** - *The domain Lovense is on* e.g `192-168-178-16.lovense.club`
- **port** - *Will proably be `30010`*
- **toyID** - *this can be found in the `toys` section, `"status": 1` means the currently active toy (if one is connected) if you have two or more (including generations) of the same device, the are likely to show up with the same name (e.g Domi and Domi 2 both listed as domi) but have different `hVersions`. If you've given them nicknames that's even easier*
